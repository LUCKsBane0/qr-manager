# QR Manager
##	Overall:
The app runs as a standalone executable, so it doesnt need any other files attached.

## How to use:
		Ctrl+alt+q
Automatically gets what's in your clipboard and depending on if it's a link or a file creates a qr code for the link directly or hosts a temporary localhost server for the file.

		Ctrl+alt+u
Creates a qr code and hosts a localhost server for file upload from other devices.
### Note:

A folder 'Uploads' will be created in the directory the executable is located in if it doesnt existe yet. This is where all uploaded files will be stored.
